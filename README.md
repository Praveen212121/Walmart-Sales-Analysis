# Walmart Sales Analysis with SQL and Python

## Project Overview




This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions.

## Project Steps taken

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL)
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Setting Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in my local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Used the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into my project.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Used the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/najir0123/walmart-10k-sales-datasets)
   - **Storage**: Saved the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python 
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Used functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Dropped rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Fix Data Types**: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as `datetime`, prices as `float`).
   - **Currency Formatting**: Used `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Checked for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 8. Load Data into MySQL 
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 9. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:
     1) Analyze Payment Methods and Sales
          
   ```sql
    SELECT 
    payment_method,
    COUNT(*) AS no_payments,
    SUM(quantity) AS no_qty_sold
    FROM walmart
    GROUP BY payment_method;
   ```

   2) Identify the Highest-Rated Category in Each Branch
   3) Determine the Busiest Day for Each Branch
   4) Calculate Total Quantity Sold by Payment Method
   5) Analyze Category Ratings by City
   6) Calculate Total Profit by Category
   7) Determine the Most Common Payment Method per Branch
   8) Analyze Sales Shifts Throughout the Day
   9) Identify Branches with Highest Revenue Decline Year-Over-Year


### 10. Project Publishing and Documentation
   - **Documentation**: Maintained well-structured documentation of the entire process.
   - **Project Publishing**: Publish the completed project on GitHub.
